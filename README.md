# Travel-Planner
Travel planner console application in C++

University first year, second term project. I designed a travel planner application which provides two views: admin and user. The admin can add, remove, modify tourist attractions, cities and tourist routes. The user can login or create a new account, see all travel options and create personalized travel. Also he can manage a favourite list of touristic destinations and see different statistics.
